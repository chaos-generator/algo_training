I tried to focus more on Python and java for sections bellow.

## Raw Arrays and Lists

Advantages:

* Fast RAMDOM or SEQUENTIAL access
* Keeps order
* allows duplicated elements

Disadvantages:

* Inserting or deleting on the middle is expensive, you have to move everything - O(n)
* When you have to append over initial allocation size, you have to move everything
