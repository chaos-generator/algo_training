# Study plan

This document contains a summary of my studies in algorithms. It contains what I've already studied and what I plan to study.

Each section contains main theory algorithms and problems related to that theory. Every time I find a problem in a context and I realize the best solution belongs to a category bellow, I add the problem there.

* [Data structures](data_structures/data_structures.md) - To refresh memory about each data structure's strong/week points, complexity of operations. This should be used as a revision before an interview.
* [Back tracking](back_tracking/back_tracking.md) - Chess problem and problems that can be solved by "brute force", without dynamic programming.
* [Combinatorial analysis](combinatorial/combinatorial_analysis_algorithms.md) - permutations, combinations, repetitions and its variations + math review
* [Sorting algorithms](sorting/sorting_algorithms.md) - Refresh ideas behind each of them (divide and conquer, recursion) and compare complexity of the best ones.
* [Parsing algorithms](parsing/parsing_algorithms.md) - Most common problems for text/language/expression parsing.
* [Greedy algorithms](greedy/greedy_algorithms.md) - Most common problems that can be solved with greedy as best option. Discussion about greedy property.
* [Dynamic programming](dynamic_prog/dynamic_programming.md) - Most common problems that can be solved with dynamic programming as best solution
* [Linear programming](linear/linear_programming.md) - TODO
* [String searching algorithms](string_searching/string_searching.md) - Most common algorithms for string searching and related problems
* [Graph algorithms](graph/graph_algorithms.md) - Most common graph algorithms
* [Computational Geometry algorithms](geometry/geometry_algorithms.md) - K-nearest point, segment intersection, convex hull, etc.
